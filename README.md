# AnvilOfDawn_SpriteExtractor
An application to assist with extracting graphics and sprites from the 1995 MS-DOS game Anvil Of Dawn.

This is currently in development, and has many bugs. Some graphics are not able to be extracted properly. 

Getting D3G files: 
1. Open your copy of ANVIL.DAT in a modern archiver such as Winrar or 7zip
2. Find the appropriate RES files
3. Unpack the RES files using QuickBMS http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm and using the script https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=8114

You can now point the Sprite Extractor at the folder containing all the D3G files.

Special thanks to Saul and Peek for their knowledge and assistance with reverse engineering the resource files!
